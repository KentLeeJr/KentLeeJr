Hello fellow developer, I’m Kent 🤘
👨‍🎓 I have my B.S. (2018) and M.S. (2019) in Aerospace Engineering from CU Boulder. 🚀✈

I am switching lanes to software as the possibilities in software are endless and exciting! 

I’m interested in pulling/manipulating data from APIs (Riot Games' League of Legends) and working with big data as well as developing algorithms  for solving problems in a fun and challenging way. 

I’m currently learning python and object oriented programming as well as becoming proficient with Mocks to aid in unit testing development. 

I’m looking to learn from others in the software development community and begin building my brand as a developer myself. 

Some hobbies and passions of mine are:
